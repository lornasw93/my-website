      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a space for my thoughts, show who I am and to showcase my projects.
        I like to think myself as a positive, bubbly and ambitious.
        When Iâ€™m not working full-time, Iâ€™m either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits.
        I enjoy problem solving and logic; I'm ambitious, like dad jokes and memes.

        I'm 27 and my car is called Karen - previously had a Felicia. ðŸš—
        I had my first taste of programming in college and have loved it ever since.
        I'm really creative and think micro-services are fab.
        I have always lived in Leeds and haven't been one for travelling all over the world - the odd holiday does nicely.
        I'll update this soon, it's hard to think of interesting things. ðŸ™Š
