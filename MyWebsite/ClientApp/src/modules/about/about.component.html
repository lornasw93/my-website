        The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a space for my thoughts, show who I am and to showcase my projects.
        I’m a software based in Leeds, UK. I have a passion for programming and all things data analytics. I enjoy working full-stack.
        I can't see myself doing anything else but programming. Everyday is different, new challenges and solutions.
        There is always something new to learn.

        I love mechanical keyboards with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/DuckyChannel-Backlit-Cherry-Keyboard-DKON1967ST-CUKPDAZT1/dp/B07Z8H928F/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E5T1RJQAMPHQ&dchild=1&keywords=ducky+one+2+sf&qid=1585605688&sprefix=ducky%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Ducky</a> being my favourite.
        I use a cracking custom built laptop with a nice 32GB RAM, 17.3" screen and 2TB SSD from <a href="https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/" target="_blank">PC Specialist</a>.
        I'm in the middle of creating my dream setup with 3 monitors (1 portrait), LED strip lights, a dark stained oak table top and 2 <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-10192824/" target="_blank">Ikea alex drawers</a>.
        I'm ambitious, positive and like dad jokes.

        When I’m not working full-time, I’m either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits.
        I enjoy problem solving and logic.
        I liked IT in high school and then had my first taste doing Software Development (2 years) in college.
        I jumped into Huddersfield university doing Computing BSc (Hons) (4 years) and for my placement year had my first experience in the job.
        After graduating with a 2:2, I worked 1.5 years as a junior software developer at <a href="http://www.atdsol.com/" target="_blank" class="tag">ATD Solutions</a>.
        Moving on, I joined <a href="https://www.stericycle.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="tag">Stericycle</a> as a junior where I progressed to a mid; and more recently joined <a href="https://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk/" target="_blank">Epiphany</a> as a .NET developer.
