      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm 27 years old. 
        The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a space for my thoughts, show who I am and to showcase my projects.
        I enjoy working full-stack.
        I like to think myself as a positive, bubbly and ambitious. 
        When I’m not working full-time, I’m either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits.
        I enjoy problem solving and logic; I'm ambitious, like dad jokes and memes.
        I am currently at <a href="https://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk/" target="_blank">Epiphany <fa-icon [icon]="faShareSquare"></fa-icon></a> as a .NET developer.
