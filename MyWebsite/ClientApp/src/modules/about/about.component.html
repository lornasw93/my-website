          When I‚Äôm not working full-time, I‚Äôm either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits.
          I had my first taste of programming in college and have loved it ever since. I'm interested in all-things dev, spreadsheets,
          jokes (dad, anti, dark humor) and micro-services. I am easy-going, positive and creative. I don't have a favourite film or tv series,
          but I appreciate a good horror, thriller and psyschological piece. Admittedly, I do have a soft spot for a very typical high school and reality viewing.

          [24/03/2021] - Since Sept 2020-ish I've been, as cheesy as it sounds, working on myself and whilst trying not to do too much, I've joined numerous communities
          mainly focused around women in tech, attended talks, more blogging, networked with strangers, accelerated side projects mainly timings, become mentor and found
          myself a mentor; in a nutshell - I'm investing in me ‚ù§.

          If I wasn't a developer I'd be a writer, quite ironic really.
