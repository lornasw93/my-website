        <p>
          The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a space for my thoughts, show who I am and to showcase my projects.
          I’m a software developer for a healthcare company in Leeds, UK. I have a passion for programming and all things data analytics.
          I enjoy working full-stack.
          I can't see myself doing anything else but programming. Everyday is different, new challenges and solutions.
          There is always something new to learn, it's forever on-going.

          When I’m not working full-time, I’m either working on side projects or learning something new. <i>OK, Netflix too...</i>
          I enjoy problem solving and logic.
          I enjoyed IT in high school and then had my first taste doing Software Development (2 years) in college.
          <i>I like this.</i> I jumped into Huddersfield university doing Computing BSc (Hons) (4 years) and for my placement year had my first experience in the job.
          <i>Confirmed: this is what I want to do.</i>
          After graduating 2:2, I worked 1.5 years as a junior software developer at a small financial consultancy company.
          Moving on, I joined a healthcare company as a junior and progressed to a mid; and more recently joined a digital agency company as a .NET developer. <i>And here I am.</i>
