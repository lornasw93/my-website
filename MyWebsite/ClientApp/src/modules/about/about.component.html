          The purpose of my portfolio website is to have a space for my thoughts, show who I am and to showcase my projects.
          I’m a software based in Leeds, UK. I have a passion for programming and all things data analytics. I enjoy working full-stack.
          I can't see myself doing anything else but programming. Everyday is different, new challenges and solutions.
          There is always something new to learn.

          I love of mechanical keyboards with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/DuckyChannel-Backlit-Cherry-Keyboard-DKON1967ST-CUKPDAZT1/dp/B07Z8H928F/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3E5T1RJQAMPHQ&dchild=1&keywords=ducky+one+2+sf&qid=1585605688&sprefix=ducky%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1">Ducky</a> being my favourite.
          I use a cracking custom built laptop with a nice 32GB RAM, 17.3" screen and 2TB SSD from <a href="https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/">PC Specialist</a>.
          I'm in the middle of creating my dream setup with 3 monitors (1 portrait), LED strip lights, a dark stained oak table top and 2 <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-10192824/">Ikea alex drawers</a>.
          I'm ambitious, positive and like dad jokes.

          When I’m not working full-time, I’m either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits. I enjoy problem solving and logic.
          I liked IT in high school and then had my first taste doing Software Development (2 years) in college. I jumped into Huddersfield university doing Computing BSc (Hons) (4 years)
          and for my placement year had my first experience in the job. After graduating with a 2:2, I worked 1.5 years as a junior software developer at a small financial consultancy company.
          Moving on, I joined a healthcare company as a junior where I progressed to a mid; and more recently joined a digital agency company as a .NET developer.
