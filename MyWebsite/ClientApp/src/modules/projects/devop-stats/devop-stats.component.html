        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Token key generated from Azure DevOps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I started up this project for my own learning with the purpose being to get an overview of useful everyday stats from DevOps.
          The expected outcome is to have 3 projects working together (frontend, backend and identity server).
          At a previous job, I found that the same questions were always asked:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who broke the build?</li>
          <li>When was the last release?</li>
          <li>Balancing out work items</li>
          <li>Generally people not being aware of what other people were up to project wise</li>
          <li>Can someone please send over the UAT URL?</li>
          <li>Which server is Website A hosted on?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I wanted to find out basic info quickly rather than going through several pages to find out what I wanted. I.e. Why did the last build fail?
          To summarise, my goal was to condense common queries into a simple dashboard where then, as a typical developer, I would benefit from the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Efficiency</li>
          <li>Less clicks</li>
          <li>Save time by asking same things</li>
          <li>(Chart) trends</li>
          <li>Visualisation</li>
        </ul>
