    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Keeping track of your epilepsy conveniently.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My older brother has been epileptic since 2012.
      To help my mum keep track of his seizures, she downloaded a mobile app and used this to record basic information i.e. dates and duration.
      All was well until one day she could no longer add records.
      She removed the app, exported that data to pen and paper, and has since been making notes in her diary.
      These notes also include details such as doctor and hospital appointments, and medication changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was talking with my mum one night about how I was struggling for ideas for projects and lack of motivation.
      Then it hit me. Epilepsy Diary. My goal is to develop an easy to use responsive website and mobile app (iOS and Android) with my mum as the project stack-holder.
      Post first release, my hope is to expand the user base and introduce more functionality.
