      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        When I hear 'side projects', I think of: buying domains and not using them, half-finished projects and lack of free time.
        In general, it's known that most people will have some sort of project graveyard - stuff that has been started but never finished.
        So, you think of an idea for a website or app, and begin to work on it. Your motivation and productivity is at an all-time high.
        And then, it stops. ðŸ›‘ Main reason most likely due to time restrictions - can be impossible to dedicate time on your project work outside a full-time job.
        The cycle begins again: have an idea for a project, start, good progress, stop.

        I really enjoy having project work to do - it keeps me busy and motivated. Sure, it's hard to actually complete with constant distractions and commitments but it's rewarding.
        I believe I only started doing project work maybe 1 or 2 years so not long ago at all, and sitting here having done SO many hours on them - I have no idea what I did before in my free time. ðŸ˜‚
        With working in the tech industry, it's so important to keep up to date with the latest stuff - or at least keep learning.
        Granted at times it can feel pretty overwhelming where I have felt I have too many things to learn - there is just so much out there.
        But that's also a good thing: everyday is different, constantly new tech coming out, new ways of doing things and better resources.

      <p><strong>I wrote a Node.js API service to get me a list of my public repos, you can see the result below. ðŸ¤¯</strong></p>
