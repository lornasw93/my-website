      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy working on projects in my spare time, it keeps me busy and motivated although while sure, at times it is difficult with a full-time job and other commitments, but it is really rewarding. In a previous role, I felt I was not getting exposure to new tech the same way everyone else on the dev team was. In this instance, I was constantly put on a separate project to everyone else whilst they were learning Angular. It suddenly hit me, why put up with it? Why am I not doing anything about it? Feeling motivated, I started learning Angular outside of work and after a while I left that job (early 2019). The spark to urn more for myself had started. Looking back, I have no idea what I did in my free time and granted, yes, at times I can feel overwhelmed due to the amount of technologies etc. out there, but overall it has been worth it.

      <p>I wrote a Node.js API service to get me a list of my public repos, you can see the result below. ðŸ¤¯</p>
