      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <p>
        In my own way, blogging as a developer is a way of expressing myself on the web whether it be because of finding something interesting,
        solving a problem or in general just having that space to write my thoughts down. It's also pretty useful for when inevitably I forget
        bits I do on a reg like setting up services and new project packages to install. <a href="https://dev.to">DEV.to</a> has given me that
        space to free my mind and be creative, accountability in a way and may be even by helping a reader with a problem I solved - even better.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        I write about anything (tech wise) that I think is both interesting and useful, including experiences. I've recently started to write
        blogs very often
      </p> <br>
      <p><strong>I wrote a Node.js API service to get me a list of my blog posts, you can see the result below. ðŸ¤¯</strong></p>
